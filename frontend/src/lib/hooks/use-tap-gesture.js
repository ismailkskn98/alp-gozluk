/**
 * The pointer gesture behind a click, recorded where the click cannot report
 * it. A `click` carries no `pointerType` in the engines that matter, so the
 * `pointerdown` before it is the only thing that says which input activated
 * the control — and whether one did at all, since keyboard activation
 * synthesizes a click with no pointer behind it.
 *
 * State goes in with the record because a click reports that no better: a
 * browser that focuses a control on contact can open the very panel the tap
 * was meant to open, and reading "is it open" at click time then undoes it.
 * What the gesture started against is what it acts on.
 *
 * The record is spent by one click and dropped by everything else, because a
 * record that outlives its gesture is worse than none:
 *
 * - A scroll or an OS gesture takes the touch away — `pointercancel`, no click
 *   ever — and the finger would sit in the record until some later click.
 * - That later click is often `Enter` on a keyboard, which arrives with no
 *   pointerdown of its own and would inherit the abandoned finger. A keydown
 *   is the start of a keyboard activation and never part of a tap, so it drops
 *   the record too.
 *
 * Both ends have to be wired by the surface: `drop` on `onPointerCancel` and
 * on `onKeyDown`.
